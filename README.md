# Final Project for CSCI E-3 Introduction to Web Programming Using JavaScript, Spring 2016

Queries DPLA API for images and displays them.

## Essential Features
- ~~accept some form of user input (choosing a state from a dropdown menu, entering text, etc.)~~
- ~~use DPLA API to search DPLA for related images~~
- ~~display images on page~~
- display select metadata on page
- link back to DPLA item record

## Non Essential Features
- more inventive way of searching: click on a map? use a datalist to allow for text entry/autocomplete?
- more metadata
- pagination/more results?
- comparison: pit two search terms against each other & return metadata
	- # of images
	- # of videos
	- # of audio files
	- # of text items
- turn into a bookmarklet? select something on a webpage and click the DPLA image search bookmarklet, and get a new page w/results 

## TODO
- ~~figure out how to validate user input to avoid dangerous searches (alphanumeric only?)~~
- better record display

## Requirements (4 of 5)
- ~~DOM element creation, deletion or modification~~
- DOM traversal
- Capturing and handling events (beyond just a “Do it!” button)
	- could do this through the US map idea
- Creating and handling a data structure (JSON, custom objects, etc)
	- maybe? 
- ~~Form validation~~
	- validate user input to be alphanumeric
- Closures
- ~~AJAX~~
